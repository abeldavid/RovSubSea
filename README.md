This is the second of a two-part project to control an underwater ROV.
This particular program receives 8-bit data packets from the controlling MCU and uses the data
to generate PWM signals of specific pulse widths.  These PWM signals are then sent to the corresponding 
ESCs of six thruster motors.

MCU is a PIC16F1937

Thrusters are Blue Robotics T100s

ESCs are Afro 30amp models

More detailed info can be found on the project's webpage: https://bitdrivencircuits.com/ROV/ROVhome.html .
It can take a little bit of time for me to update the webpage with the latest changes and often times there is not
a 1:1 relationship between the code posted here and the code presented on the website.
